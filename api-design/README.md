# OpenAPI 3.x and JSON Schema

As of version 3.1, Open API is [fully compatible with JSON Schema 2019-09 and later](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/openapi-v31-and-json-schema-2019-09). 

## Visual Editors

[Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io/studio/) - my favorite OpenAPI schema editor so far. Has built-in mocking server ([Prism](https://stoplight.io/open-source/prism/)) and validator ([Spectral](https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral/)) and more! Schweet. 

## Implementations of OpenAPI v3.1 and higher

https://json-schema.org/implementations.html

- [Validators](https://json-schema.org/implementations.html#validators)
- [Hyper-Schema](https://json-schema.org/implementations.html#hyper-schema)
- [Schema Generators](https://json-schema.org/implementations.html#schema-generators)
- [Generators from Schemas](https://json-schema.org/implementations.html#generators-from-schemas)
- [Utilities](https://json-schema.org/implementations.html#utilities)

## [Json Schema Store](https://www.schemastore.org/json/) 

At least 255 different [JSON Schema files](https://www.schemastore.org/json/) (some in yml and some in json format). A great resource to validate all kinds of stuff agiainst, or just learn how to build a JSON schema file the RIGHT way (kinda). 



# GraphQL

## Visual Editors

[GraphQL Designer](http://graphqldesigner.com/) - free, but probably also commercial 

[GraphQL Editor](https://app.graphqleditor.com/) - commercial - you get 2 free public projects and pay for more. Looks nice as hell though.
