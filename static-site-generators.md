# Static Site Generators

## Go (aka Golang)

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - static site generator that claims to be the world's fastest.

## Ruby

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - Pretty popular. Used by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Typically you use a Ruby based command line tool to run the jekyll commands, but it's available in other flavors as well if you hate Ruby. 

## NodeJS

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) - Way beyond a static site generator, it basically lets you build PWAs with SSR but in a way that is more like a static site generator based on React components, with the ability to pull in data and content from basically anywhere. 

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) - Like Jekyll, but less strict about some stuff and also written in NodeJS instead of Ruby. Becuase, why not?

[Assemble](https://assemble.io/) - a Grunt an Yeoman based site generator that converts markdown into static HTML. (This is very old an should probably never be used.)

[Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/) - claims to be a flexible, minimalistic, multi-platform static site generator built on top of Node.js.

[Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) - tagline: An extremely simple, *pluggable* static site generator. All of the logic in Metalsmith is handled by plugins. You simply chain them together. This makes Metalsmith one of the more versatile systems.

 [Hexo](http://hexo.io/) - Of all the Node.js static site generators listed in this article, Hexo is by far the most popular on GitHub. Hexo’s documentation is straightforward, beautiful, and includes a comments section at the bottom of each page. Besides, on GitHub you can find a lot of minimal themes, many of which are forks or derivatives of [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) themes. Hexo is very much a descendant of Ghost, with a focus on user experience and minimalism. It also tries to get you up and running as fast as possible. I believe this makes Hexo the most beginner/designer-friendly system for creating lightweight blogs.

[Punch](http://laktek.github.io/punch/) is one of the two Node.js-based static site generators in this article that claims to be easy for both designers and developers. It’s easy to set up Punch, but it gives you very little more than a blank page when you start working with it. A basic starter theme is available, but the rest is up to you. Unlike some of the other static site generation, Punch doesn’t offer a custom plugin system. It relies on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for installing alternative CSS pre-processors, JavaScript libraries, and so on.

[DocPad](https://docpad.org/) - Even with a cursory glance at [DocPad](https://docpad.org/)‘s website, it’s clear that DocPad is an ambitious project. If you were looking for a point-by-point illustration of what sets DocPad apart from Jekyll, you don’t have to look too far. At the bottom of [DocPad’s introduction page](https://docpad.org/docs/intro) you can find a comparison table showing what each system has to offer. These criteria are, of course, based on what DocPad deems necessary for a full-featured CMS.
