# Streaming Video Info

[Here's a great overview of](streaming-protocols.md) all the streaming video protocols.

## Streaming Video Production Software

Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) - [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)

*  Web Socket plugin for OBS

Restream Studio - Kinda like an OBS but just for streaming to Restream.io.

## Multi-Stream Services

Stream to a single endpoint which "restreams" to multiple services

* [Restream.io](https://restream.io/join/17Lro) - excellent free and paid services
* [Castr.io](https://castr.io/) - Excellent, but the free service is not as good. 

Main Video Streaming Platforms

[YouTube Events](https://studio.youtube.com/video/) - replacement for deprecated [YouTube Stream Now](https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard?ar=1600126013044&nv=1) and old YouTube Events

## Blockchain Based Streaming Services

[d.tube]() - a youtube clone that uses a cryptocurrency called DTC to determine popularity and reward content creators. Files are generally hosted via IPFS servers. Looks like it could be a cool alternative content distribution concept, but it's currently full of mostly garbage. 

[dlive.tv](https://dlive.tv/) - appears to be a live streaming version of d.tube, but it's powered by "Lemon" tokens (LT). Seems to be mostly full of gamer and conspiracy nut streamers.
