# Cool Programming Libraries

A random assortment of libs for whatever language. I started this list because I wanted to make note of some cool Google code projects written in Java and/or C++, but until the list gets bigger I'm throwing random stuff for any language in here. 

## Google GitHub Repository

 Google has a shit-ton (approx 1,600 repositories) of cool open source projects on github. Check them out at https://github.com/google 

Better yet, check out the **[Google Open Source]( https://opensource.google/)** web site or **[explore their featured projects]( https://opensource.google/projects/explore/featured )**.

### Some Cool Google Projects

- [**GSON**](https://github.com/google/gson) - Google's JSON library for Java.  Convert Java Objects into JSON and back. Faster than Jackson for small objects such as api responses. For serializing large objects Jaskson is still faster and/or more efficient.  
- **[GUAVA](https://github.com/google/guava)** -  Google core libraries for Java  - has many convenience utility functions and is often used by other non-google projects.
- **[LibPhoneNumber](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber)** - phone number validation, formatting, and other cool functionality for phone numbers in Java, C++, and Javascript. 
- **[RE2 Regular Expression Engine](https://github.com/google/re2)** - is a fast, safe, thread-friendly alternative to backtracking regular expression engines like those used in PCRE, Perl, and Python. It is a **C++ library** but has wrappers for most other languages (C, Erlang, Inferno, Node.js, OCaml, Perl, Python, R, Ruby).
- **[Data Transfer Project](https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project)** -  The Data Transfer Project makes it easy for people to transfer their data between online service providers. We are establishing a common framework, including data models and protocols, to enable direct transfer of data both into and out of participating online service providers.

- **[Cel-Go](https://github.com/google/cel-go)** -  Fast, portable, non-Turing complete expression evaluation with gradual typing (Go) [https://opensource.google.com/projectâ€¦](https://opensource.google.com/projects/cel) 
- [**Cel-Cpp**](google/cel-cpp) - same as Cel-Go, but for C++
- **[Nomulus](https://github.com/google/nomulus)** - Top-level domain name registry service on Google App Engine [https://registry.google](https://registry.google/)
- [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer) - Extensible media player for Android
- [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) - Google Testing and Mocking Framework for C++
- [**Pix Image Viewer**](https://github.com/google/pix-image-viewer) -  Desktop image viewer written in RUST. View thousands of images in a zoomable, pannable grid.
