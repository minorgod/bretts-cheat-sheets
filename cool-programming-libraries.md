# Cool Programming Libraries

A random assortment of libs for whatever language. I started this list because I wanted to make note of some cool Google code projects written in Java and/or C++, but until the list gets bigger I'm throwing random stuff for any language in here. 

## Google Libs

**[RE2](https://github.com/google/re2)** - is a fast, safe, thread-friendly alternative to backtracking regular expression engines like those used in PCRE, Perl, and Python. It is a **C++ library** but has wrappers for most other languages.

```reStructuredText
A C wrapper is at https://github.com/marcomaggi/cre2/.
An Erlang wrapper is at https://github.com/dukesoferl/re2/ and on Hex (hex.pm).
An Inferno wrapper is at https://github.com/powerman/inferno-re2/.
A Node.js wrapper is at https://github.com/uhop/node-re2/ and on NPM (npmjs.com).
