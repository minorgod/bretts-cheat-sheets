# Cloud Storage

## Blockchain Based Cloud Storage

[Storj](https://storj.io/) - Looks cool. I own some of their crypto tokens (STORJ). They are commercial, they charge around $10 per terrabyte per month as of today (2020-08-28). Storj is the platform, but the actual service where you can buy storage on their network is at [tardigrade.io](https://tardigrade.io/). Their aim is to keep pricing around half of what the major cloud providers (AWS) charge. 

[Sia](https://sia.tech/) - Decentralized storage for the post-cloud world. Their words, not mine. Looks cool though. Costs somewhere between $1-$2 per month per terrabyte, which kicks the ass out of the big commercial storage providers. You pay with their crypto tokens called "saicoin" which is a bit of a pain, but you can mine them too, or rent out your extra storage to earn coins (which may or may not be a net positive in terms of cost of electricity, bandwidth and storage upkeep). 

## Consumer Level Cloud Storage

[Microsoft OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/compare-onedrive-plans-2) - Of all the major players, dhis is by far the best paid option for 1TB of storage. 5GB free, 100GB for $1.99month, or 1TB for $69.99/year which includes the major MS Office apps. 

[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) - $9.99/month for 1TB or $99.99 paid annually. Also, Google Photos lets you store unlimited "High Quality" photos for free, but original quality version will use up your Drive storage. Also, Email attachments from Gmail use up your Drive space. 

[Amazon Cloud Drive](https://www.amazon.com/photos/storage/plans) - unlimited photo storage for Prime users, other types of data is extra I guess? Video is limited to 5GB. For additional non-photo data it seems you pay varying prices, but $1.99/month per gig, or $6.99/month per terrabyte. If you pay by the year it's even cheaper. 

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/basic) - one of the first on the scene to offer a decent sized free storage solution. Now their free 2GB plan seems tiny and antiquated since Google and Microsoft offer 100GB for free. 

[Box](https://www.box.com/) - They don't want to be consumer-level as evidenced by the fact that they are the only solution without a free tier. Very overpriced too. 

[iCloud Drive](https://www.icloud.com) - According to zdnet.com, "Apple's good at many things, but cloud storage isn't one of them". 

[Carbonite](https://ww2.carbonite.com/) - I hesistate to even include them because their $47.99 per terrabyte plan is only for 1pc. 

Yeah, I know there's others, but they aren't interesting to me right now. 

## Cloud Storage Services

[Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/cloud-storage-pricing/) - I'm putting these guys first because so far in my research they seem to crush the competition on price per terrabyte when you factor in bandwidth for accessing your data. They claim to be 80% cheaper than Amazon S3 with no egress charges -- in other words you don't pay to access your data. That's a huge deal if you download a significant portion of what you upload each month. Pricing is currently around $5.99 per TB/month. 

Amazon Simple Storage Service (aka: Amazon S3)

Amazon Glacier - long term object storage

AWS Storage Gateway - Hybrid Cloud Storage

Microsoft Azure Cloud Storage

I[BM Cloud Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/storage) - yep, IBM still does stuff. 

## Commercial FTP Services

Before the big cloud providers appeared, hosted sFTP services might have seemed like a decent idea, but now these services seem overpriced and antiquated. Unless you have very specific use cases that require it, you're much better off with a real cloud storage service. 

[Egnyte](https://www.egnyte.com/) - I actually used these guys back in the day for backing up and sharing huge numbers of high-res product images for a big ecommerce company. They charge $10 per employee/month paid annually, which, again, seems overpriced, but it's not outrageous. 

[Exavault](https://www.exavault.com/) - Don't even bother. Ridiculously expensive. Don't know how they could possibly be getting any customers. 

[Files.com](https://www.exavault.com/) - $10/month per user with 5 user minimum for 1TB of monthly usage. In other words, overpriced.
