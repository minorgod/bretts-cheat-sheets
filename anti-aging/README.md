## Other Compounds

**SRT2104** - Created by Sirtris (GlaxoSmithKline) as an alternative to SRT501 (basically a more bioactive form of resveratrol). In [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4640558/) it appears to have documented positive effects for Psoriasis. 

SRT2379 - Another Sirtris (GlaxoSmithKline) alternative to SRT501 that, so far, has failed to show positive results in some studies.
