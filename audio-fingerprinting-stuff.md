## The following list was taken from the MusicBrainz URL above. 

### Open Source

- The fingerprint in Kurt Rosenfeld's [FDMF](http://www.w140.com/audio/).
- [MusicURI](https://github.com/dkourtesis/musicuri), part of the [Mpeg-7 Audio DB](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mpeg7audiodb) project.
- [AudioScout](http://code.google.com/p/audioscout/). Based on the [pHash](http://www.phash.org/) audio fingerprinting library, developed by the same authors. Uses the "Philips Robust Hashing" algorithm. Moved to GitHub here: https://github.com/starkdg/JAudioScout
- [OpenFP](http://open-fp.sourceforge.net/).
- [Echoprint](http://echoprint.me/). Audio fingerprinting solution developed by the Echo Nest.
- *[defunct]* [libFooID](http://code.google.com/p/libfooid/). An audio fingerprinting library used by, and developed for [foosic](http://www.foosic.org/).
- *[defunct]* [Freetantrum](http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetantrum). It seems to be a dead project (its home page was replaced with an advert for unrelated things in 2001), but it may be worth investigating and resurrecting the code they produced.
- *[defunct]* [jHears](http://jhears.org/) is an acoustic fingerprinting framework based on [FutureProofFingerPrint](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Future_Proof_Fingerprint) design by Geoff Schmidt (formerly of Tuneprint). jHears is developed by Juha Heljoranta.

### Partially Open-Source

- [Last.fm](http://blog.last.fm/2010/07/09/fingerprint-api-and-app-updated). The client-side audio fingerprinting library ([fplib](https://github.com/lastfm/Fingerprinter)) is open-source. Uses the "[Computer Vision for Music Identification](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yke/musicretrieval/)" algorithm.

### Commercial

- [ACRCloud](http://www.acrcloud.com/). a cloud platform that helps companies and developers integrate ACR (Automatic Content Recognition) techniques to recognize audios and videos, monitor radio streams, detect live TV contents and so on. It's high-quality and cost efficient. [Quick Free Trial](https://github.com/acrcloud-demo/audio-recognition-quick-trial/) | [Docs](http://docs.acrcloud.com/)
- [Audible Magic](http://audiblemagic.com/). [This article](http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/ArticleReader.aspx?ArticleID=4473&IssueID=128) compares business models for Philips & Audible Magic
- [AudioID](http://business.mufin.com/solutions/audioid). Developed at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS and the Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technology IDMT](http://www.idmt.fraunhofer.de/eng/research_topics/audioid.htm), now provided by [mufin GmbH](http://www.mufin.com/).
- [Shazam](http://www.shazam.com/). Proprietary music fingerprinting system, currently offered directly to users over the telephone.
- [Rovi Media Recognition Service](http://www.rovicorp.com/products/developers/innovate/rovi_cloud_services.htm) (formelly [AMG LASSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMG_LASSO)).
- [Gracenote MusicID](http://www.gracenote.com/products/musicid/).
- Philips. One of the first scalable audio fingerprint algorithms. Described [here](http://ismir2002.ismir.net/proceedings/02-FP04-2.pdf) and [here](http://ict.ewi.tudelft.nl/pub/doets/paper027.pdf).
- [USC](http://spiedl.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id=PSISDG005242000001000055000001&idtype=cvips&gifs=yes)
- And possibly most ridiculously of all: [The Song Tapper](http://www.songtapper.com/s/tappingmain.bin)
