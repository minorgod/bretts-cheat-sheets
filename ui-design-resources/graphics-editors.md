# Graphics Editors

This list does not include most of the Adobe tools because you already know about those. 

## UI Design Tools

[Lunacy](https://icons8.com/lunacy) - This is shaping up to be a fantastic UI design tool. This is basically the Windows version of the MacOS-only Sketch design tool. Built-in icons, photos, vector illustrations, and more. Full compatibility with Sketch.

[Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) - Another Sketch alternative from Adobe. 

## Raster Image Editors

[GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)](https://www.gimp.org/) - the original open source image editor. It's no Photoshop, but you can get most things done with it. 

[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) - Commandline image manipulation. Very popular for use in conjunction with scripting languages such as PHP. 

## Vector Image Editors

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) - great open-source tool for creating and editing SVGs. It can be a bit slow and the UI is pretty clunky, but it's still a great tool. 

[Lunacy](https://icons8.com/lunacy) - Yeah I know I listed it twice, but it does vector editing too! Hard to say enough great things about this app. I just wish it could export to SVG, PDF or AI format. 

[Autotracer](https://www.autotracer.org/) - convert raster images to vectors...FREE! Not necessarily the best quality, but not bad either, especially considering the price....which is FREE! Did I mention it's free?

[VectorMagic](https://vectormagic.com/) - It can autotrace raster images at a really high quality, but unfortunately it ain't free...not even close. Costs $9.95 / month or $295.00 for the desktop version and they don't bother to tell you about the cost until after you upload an image, convert it to vectors and then try to download it. I call bullshit!! 

## Adobe Tools

Okay, I said I wasn't including them, but I needed a place to put free tools related to Adobe products such as free photoshop brushes...
