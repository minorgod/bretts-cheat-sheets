# Icon Fonts

## Open Source

[Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) - "Simply beautiful open source icons"

[FreePik](https://www.freepik.com/) - free vector resources

## Free and/or commercial

[IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/) - the site I have always used to create custom icon fonts for the web. Great [web-based icon editor](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select). 

[icons8](https://icons8.com/) - mix of free and commercial icon fonts. Editable vectors available for some or all of them. Have great free collections of common logos. Check out the [ios logos](https://icons8.com/icon/pack/logos/ios). They also make the "[Lunacy](https://icons8.com/lunacy)" vector editor for Windows which is supposed to be an alternative to "Sketch" on MacOS.
