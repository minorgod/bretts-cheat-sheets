# The Top 5 Nootropic Herbs

### Ashwagandha

This is one of the most-widely used nootropic herbs. Ashwagandha is championed for its ability to reduce anxiety and stress, improve sleep quality, and improve overall cognition. And it's been used in tradition medicine all over the world for millennia. It's sometimes refereed to as “the king of Ayurvedic herbs.” Ayurveda is the traditional medicine of India.

Ashwagandha, like several herbs on this list, is an [adaptogen](https://nootropicszone.com/the-different-types-of-nootropics-2/). These are substances that increase stress resistance and stabilize the body. Ashwagandha has been shown to have an adaptogenic effect on a variety of bodily functions. In addition to its nootropic properties, ashwagandha can improve blood pressure and cholesterol levels, reduce cortisol, and even boost testosterone levels in men.

### Rhodiola Rosea

This is another adaptogenic herb that grows naturally all over the world. Like ashwagandha, rhodiola rosea (often simply called rhodiola) has been used in traditional medicine for centuries.

Ginkgo tree.

Of all these nootropic herbs, this one is probably the most-widely known. Ginkgo biloba, often simply called ginkgo, is the most-commonly-ingested herb for brain health. It comes from the maidenhair tree, one of the oldest tree species on the planet. Ginkgo has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine and has also been used by several other cultures.

As a nootropic herb, ginkgo can improve memory, slow cognitive decline, and improve overall cognition. Some users also report a reduction in anxiety and boost in mood, though ginkgo usually isn't taken specifically for these reasons. There is a bit of science to support these claims, although some of the results have been mixed. And generally, ginkgo is very well tolerated.

### 5. Mucuna Pruriens

This last substance on our list of the top five nootropic herbs is another that has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Mucuna pruriens, often simply referred to as mucuna, has been used to treat a variety of disorders from snake bites to Parkinson's disease. In recent years, mucuna has become somewhat popular for its nootropic properties.

Mucuna has been shown to increase dopamine levels in the brain. Dopamine is a [neurotransmitter](https://nootropicszone.com/neurotransmitter-basics/) that is known to play a major role in motivation, anxiety, focus, drive, pleasure, and more. This goes a long way to explain the benefits that mucuna users often report. Some of the nootropic benefits of mucuna include increased motivation and focus, improved mood, and reduced anxiety.
