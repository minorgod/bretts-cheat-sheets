# Content Management Systems

There are a zillion CMSes out there and dozens of paradigms in terms of the conventions they use and the architecture and implementation. These are but a few of the more interesting or popular ones. It is by no means an exhaustive list, it's just a way for me to remember which ones exist to jog my memory. 

## The Obvious

[Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) - It's prolific, antiquated, powerful, feature-rich, and somehow has survived its roots as a pile of garbage PHP code. Slowly but surely it has evolved into something that somehow doesn't totally suck, but still kinda does. Mostly this is due to the legacy codebase. But if you know it well, you might just love it. There's more add-ons for Wordpress than you can possibly imagine. If you want to add "x" feature and can live with someone else's idea of how that feature should be implemented, you can likely find a wordpress plugin or 3rd-party platform that ties into Wordpress to get it done. "Real Developers" will cringe if you suggest using Wordpress to launch a new site, but you'll probably be able to launch while they are still writing unit tests. I should probably have already redone my own site with Wordpress instead of building a custom CMS in Laravel just to keep in practice, but I didn't.  

### Notable Wordpress Addons

- Woo Commerce - the defacto standard for ecommerce platforms in Wordpress. 
- LearnDash - A popular Learning Management System (LMS) for Wordpress

Now that we've got Wordpress out of the way, here's some more interesting options.

## Headless / API-Driven CMSes
