## Project Management

[Trello](https://trello.com/) - online project management

[YouTrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/) - Yet another great JetBrains project. It's pretty minmalistic, but good, and free for teams of up to 10 users. Can be self-hosted or hosted in their cloud. Ties in nicely to their [other products](https://www.jetbrains.com/products.html) such as their IDEs and [code review](https://www.jetbrains.com/upsource/), Continuous Integration (CI) products such as [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/features) and [Space](https://www.jetbrains.com/space/)
